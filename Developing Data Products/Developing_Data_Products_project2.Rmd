## Understanding Gas Mileage

One of the many things that influence a car choice is whether or not it is fuel efficient. Using the `mtcars`, we ar going to investigate what factors affect a cars fuel efficiency.

We are going to plot weight (`wt`) vs. mileage (`mpg`) as the x and y axis. We 
visualize the number of cylinders (`cyl`) as colors and the amount of
horsepower (`hp`) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Visualizing the Data

```{r plot, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
